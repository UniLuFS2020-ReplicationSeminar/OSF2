# OSF2
Data Mining Class Exercise 2 for Olga, Simon and Fabian

## Folder Structure
- [`scripts`](https://github.com/UniLuFS2020-ReplicationSeminar/OSF2/tree/main/scripts) includes all R scripts needed to reproduce this project
- [`output`](https://github.com/UniLuFS2020-ReplicationSeminar/OSF2/tree/main/output) contains the outputs generated by the R scripts, including the knitted HTML report

## Script Documentation
- Running [`01 - api request.R`](https://github.com/UniLuFS2020-ReplicationSeminar/OSF2/blob/main/scripts/01%20-%20api%20request.R) requires your own [API key](https://open-platform.theguardian.com/access/).
- In order to successfully knit [`output/report.Rmd`](https://github.com/UniLuFS2020-ReplicationSeminar/OSF2/blob/main/output/report.Rmd), [scripts `01` through `05`](https://github.com/UniLuFS2020-ReplicationSeminar/OSF2/tree/main/scripts) have to be run in advance. These scripts download, clean and prepare the data and visualisations required for the report. **Warning**: Scripts [`02`](https://github.com/UniLuFS2020-ReplicationSeminar/OSF2/blob/main/scripts/02%20-%20create%20corpus.R) and [`05`](https://github.com/UniLuFS2020-ReplicationSeminar/OSF2/blob/main/scripts/05%20-%20topic%20modelling.R) take about 2 hours each, so if you're strapped for time, [`output/report.html`](https://github.com/UniLuFS2020-ReplicationSeminar/OSF2/blob/main/output/report.html) provides the fully knitted final report.

## Andrea's Feedback from [CE1](https://github.com/UniLuFS2020-ReplicationSeminar/OSF)
> You worked reproducibly using advanced features of GitHub (e.g., the todo list!). The substantive part (the idea, the research question...) is usually not considered in this seminar, but in your case is really well-developed and so it boosted the grade a but. It could lead to a reseach paper. If you want to work at it together I am willing to supervise. Excellent! You missed the 6.0 grade because you did not use issues and had only one PR, ideally each one of you would have made one. Also, you could do a few more commits to practice (it's below average).
